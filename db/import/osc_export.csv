His life is a glimpse of a Mormon world whose disappearance coincided with the death of this “pious yet rambunctiously radical preacher, flogging away at his people, demanding otherworldliness and constant sacrifice.” It was “an eschatological, pre-millennial world in which every individual teetered between salvation and damnation and in which unsanitary privies and appropriating a stray cow held the same potential for eternal doom as blasphemy and adultery.”<br><br>Updated and newly illustrated with more photographs, this second edition of the award-winning documentary history (first published in 1982) chronicles Grant’s ubiquitous role in the Mormon history of the 1840s and ’50s. In addition to serving as counselor to Brigham Young during two tumultuous and influential years at the end of his life, he also portentously befriended Thomas L. Kane, worked to temper his unruly brother-in-law William Smith, captained a company of emigrants into the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, and journeyed to the East on several missions to bolster the position of the Mormons during the crises surrounding the runaway judges affair and the public revelation of polygamy.<br><br>Jedediah Morgan Grant’s voice rises powerfully in these pages, startling in its urgency in summoning his people to sacrifice and moving in its tenderness as he communicated to his family.

"32","Hearken, O Ye People: The Historical Setting of Joseph Smith’s O","<b>Hearken, O Ye People:<br>The Historical Setting of Joseph Smith’s Ohio Revelations</b><br><br>by Mark Lyman Staker<br><br>More of Mormonism’s canonized revelations originated in or near Kirtland than any other place. Yet many of the events connected with those revelations and their 1830s historical context have faded over time.Barely twenty-five years after the first of these Ohio revelations, Brigham Young lamented in 1856: “These revelations, after a lapse of years, become mystified [sic] to those who were not personally acquainted with the circumstances at the time they were given.” He gloomily predicted that eventually the revelations “may be as mysterious to our children . . . as the revelations contained in the Old and New Testaments are to this generation.” Now, more than 150 years later, the distance between what Brigham Young and his Kirtland contemporaries considered common knowledge and our understanding of the same material today has widened into a sometimes daunting gap.<br><br>Mark Staker narrows the chasm in <i>Hearken, O Ye People</i> by reconstructing the cultural experiences by which Kirtland’s Latter-day Saints made sense of the revelations Joseph Smith pronounced. This volume rebuilds that exciting decade using clues from numerous archives, privately held records, museum collections, and even the soil where early members planted corn and homes. From this vast array of sources he shapes a detailed narrative of weather, religious backgrounds, dialect differences, race relations, theological discussions, food preparation, frontier violence, astronomical phenomena, and myriad daily customs of nineteenth-century life. The result is a “from the ground up” experience that today’s Latter-day Saints can all but walk into and touch.<br><br><br><i>“I am not aware of a more deeply researched and richly contextualized study of any period of Mormon church history than Mark Staker's study of Mormons in Ohio. We learn about everything from the details of Alexander Campbell's views on priesthood authority to the road conditions and weather on the four Lamanite missionaries' journey from New York to Ohio. All the Ohio revelations and even the First Vision are made to pulse with new meaning. This book sets a new standard of in-depth research in Latter-day Saint history.”</i><br>-Richard Bushman, Claremont Graduate University, author of <i>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</i><br><br><br>About the author:<br>Mark Lyman Staker (Ph.D., Cultural anthropology, University of Florida) began work as curator of the Museum of Church History and Art in Salt Lake City in 1993. For more than twelve years Mark has been involved in historic sites restoration and nineteenth-century expressions of the Latter-day Saint experience. He received the J.

Compton<br><br>Many Mormon dreams flourished in Missouri. So did many Mormon nightmares.<br><br>	The Missouri period--especially from the summer of 1838 when Joseph took over vigorous, personal direction of this new Zion until the spring of 1839 when he escaped after five months of imprisonment--represents a moment of intense crisis in Mormon history. Representing the greatest extremes of devotion and violence, commitment and intolerance, physical suffering and terror--mobbings, battles, massacres, and political “knockdowns”--it shadowed the Mormon psyche for a century.<br><br>	Leland Gentry was the first to step beyond this disturbing period as a one-sided symbol of religious persecution and move toward understanding it with careful documentation and evenhanded analysis. In Fire and Sword, Todd Compton collaborates with Gentry to update this foundational work with four decades of new scholarship, more insightful critical theory, and the wealth of resources that have become electronically available in the last few years.<br><br>	Compton gives full credit to Leland Gentry's extraordinary achievement, particularly in documenting the existence of Danites and in attempting to tell the Missourians’ side of the story; but he also goes far beyond it, gracefully drawing into the dialogue signal interpretations written since Gentry and introducing the raw urgency of personal writings, eyewitness journalists, and bemused politicians seesawing between human compassion and partisan harshness. In the lush Missouri landscape of the Mormon imagination where Adam and Eve had walked out of the garden and where Adam would return to preside over his posterity, the towering religious creativity of Joseph Smith and clash of religious stereotypes created a swift and traumatic frontier drama that changed the Church.<br><br>Hardcover, ISBN: 978-1-58958-120-3",NULL,"0.0000",NULL,NULL,NULL,"History","Gentry, Leland Homer and Compton"

The legendary native prophets who predicted the coming of white missionaries whose preaching resulted in the conversions of whole villages . . . The legendary miracles of Matthew Cowley . . .<br><br>     These well known stories of Mormonism in New Zealand are only a fraction of the miracles of faith and perseverance that actually happened. In From Tiki to Temple, Marjorie Newton of Sidney, Australia, twice winner of the Reese Award for her scholarly research, presents a nuanced and richly contextualized history of what may be Mormonism's most amazing mission story in the nineteenth century. Beginning tentatively in 1854 with the arrival of the first elders, Mormonism flourished until, a century later in 1958 the New Zealand Temple was dedicated, the country's first stake was organized, and the New Zealand Mission was divided.<br><br>	This story celebrates the faith, courage, and dedication of the North American missionaries, and the corresponding faith, courage, and dedication of their converts, whether Maori or Pakeha, many of whose stories are told here for the first time. Among them are Charles Wesley Wandell, who served his first mission south of the equator for the Latter-day Saints and his second for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In 1886, nine-year-old Pirika Whaanga became the first Maori to emigrate to Utah. Mary Ann Denham Burnett, resistant when her husband joined the Church in England, agreed to emigrate with him anywhere in the world as long as it had no Mormons. New Zealand in 1858 seemed far enough away. Apostle David O. McKay overcame laryngitis in 1921 to preach to hundreds of Saints gathered for a five-day hui tau.<br><br>	This heart-warming and scholarly account of an amazingly successful encounter between a traditional culture and Utah missionaries is a between-the-lines reading of on-going negotiations between cultures, classes, languages, and faith--all of them united by love.<br><br>Hardcover, ISBN: 978-1-58958-121-0",NULL,"0.0000",NULL,NULL,NULL,"History","Newton, Marjorie"

Her prize-winning novel has never been out of print, and its portrayal of the founding of St. George draws on her own family history to produce its unforgettable and candid portrait of plural marriage's challenges along with its winsome, gallant, and sparkling heroine Clory McIntyre.<br><br>	Yet Maurine's life is full of contradictions and unanswered questions. Why did she never finish her projected trilogy after writing what she considered to be its first volume? Why, when she considered herself an outcast from St. George society, did she never leave it for longer than a few months? What happened to her dreams of romantic love, marriage, and a family? Given the on-going popularity of <i>The Giant Joshua</i> and at least three attempts to put the story on the screen, why has a movie never been made? For extended periods of her life, she was paralyzed by personal suffering, yet did her greatest creative achievement emerge from that pain?<br><br>	Veda Tebbs Hale, a personal friend of the paradoxical novelist, answers these questions with sympathy and tact, nailing each insight down with thorough research in Whipple's vast but under-utilized collected papers. By her mastery of Whipple's letters, diaries, exhaustive oral histories, and draft after draft of unrealized dreams, Veda Hale bring a novelist's life into focus. Exasperating, dazzlingly creative, courageous, brave, frequently misguided, Maurine Whipple emerges in this biography as an unforgettable character in her own right. <br><br>Hardcover, ISBN: 978-1-58958-122-7",NULL,"0.0000",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Biography","Hale, Veda Tebbs"

Millions Shall Know Brother Joseph Again explores images of Joseph Smith from a variety of perspectives--not only the devotion of believers but the hostility and skepticism of opponents. Joseph emerges from the folk memories as well as scholarly analyses. One things both ends of the spectrum agreed on was that Joseph was a towering figure, larger than life.<br><br>	Receiving special attention is the aftermath of Joseph's sudden and shocking assassination. Justifications for murder, struggles with overwhelming grief, and the search for prose and poetic images to capture the desolating loss produce a seldom-explored body of formal and informal works close to the event itself.<br><br>	Written in the graceful and eloquent style that is a hallmark of Davis Bitton's prose, these eleven essays capture not only the scholarly insights of one of Mormonism's most seasoned scholars but also the warmth of personal feelings and convictions about Mormonism's founding prophet.

Meldrum and Stephens examine the merits and the fallacies of DNA-based interpretations that challenge the Book of Mormon’s historicity. They provide clear guides to the science, summarize the studies, illuminate technical points with easy-to-grasp examples, and spell out the data’s implications.<br><br>The results? There is no straight-line conclusion between DNA evidence and “Lamanites.” The Book of Mormon’s validity lies beyond the purview of scientific empiricism—as it always has.

After delivering the final proofs of his landmark study, <i>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</i> to Knopf in July 2005, Bushman crisscrossed the country from coast to coast, delivering numerous addresses on Joseph Smith at scholarly conferences, academic symposia, and firesides. This startlingly candid memoir concludes eleven months later with an article written for Common-Place in August 2006.<br><br>Bushman confesses to hope and humility, an unexpected numbness when he expected moments of triumph, and genuine apprehension as he awaits reviews. He frets at the polarization that dismissed the book as either too hard on Joseph Smith or too easy. He yields to a very human compulsion to check sales figures on amazon.com, but partway through the process stepped back with the recognition, “The book seems to be cutting its own path now, just as [I] hoped.” <br><br>For readers coming to grips with the ongoing puzzle of the Prophet and the troublesome dimensions of their own faith, Richard Bushman, a temple sealer and stake patriarch but also a prize-winning scholar, openly but not insistently presents himself as a believer. “I believe enough to take Joseph Smith seriously,” he says. He draws comfort both from what he calls his “mantra” (“Today I will be a follower of Jesus Christ”) and also from ongoing engagement with the intellectual challenges of explaining Joseph Smith.<br><br><i>“The diary is possibly unparalleled—an author of a recent book candidly dissecting his experiences with both Mormon and non-Mormon audiences . . . certainly deserves wider distribution—in part because it shows a talented historian laying open his vulnerabilities, and also because it shows how much any historian lays on the line when he writes about Joseph Smith.”<br></i>—Dennis Lythgoe, <i>Deseret News</i><br><br><i>“By turns humorous and poignant, this behind-the-scenes look at Richard Bushman’s public and private ruminations about Joseph Smith reveals a great deal—not only about the inner life of one of our greatest scholars, but about Mormonism at the dawn of the 21st century.”<br></i>—Jana Riess, co-author of <i>Mormonism for Dummies</i><br><br>Paperback, 140 pages, ISBN 978-1-58958-102-9","bushman med.jpg","14.9500",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Biography","Bushman, Richard L."

Second Witness, a new six-volume series from Greg Kofford Books, takes a detailed, verse-by-verse look at the Book of Mormon. It marshals the best of modern scholarship and new insights into a consistent picture of the Book of Mormon as a historical document. Taking a faithful but scholarly approach to the text and reading it through the insights of linguistics, anthropology, and ethnohistory, the commentary approaches the text from a variety of perspectives: how it was created, how it relates to history and culture, and what religious insights it provides.<br><br>The commentary accepts the best modern scholarship, which focuses on a particular region of Mesoamerica as the most plausible location for the Book of Mormon’s setting. For the first time, that location—its peoples, cultures, and historical trends—are used as the backdrop for reading the text. The historical background is not presented as proof, but rather as an explanatory context.<br><br>The commentary does not forget Mormon’s purpose in writing. It discusses the doctrinal and theological aspects of the text and highlights the way in which Mormon created it to meet his goal of “convincing . . . the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.”<br><br><br><i>""Gardner not only provides a unique tool for understanding the Book of Mormon as an ancient document written by real, living prophets, but he sets a standard for Latter-day Saint thinking and writing about scripture, providing a model for all who follow.

"52","Exploring Mormon Thought: Volume 3, Of God and Gods","<b>Exploring Mormon Thought<br>Volume 3: Of God and Gods </b><br><br>by Blake T. Ostler<br><br>In his long-anticipated third volume, Of God and Gods, Blake Ostler steps through the common complaint that Mormons aren’t Christians because they believe in three separate individuals in the Godhead as well as the deification of human beings. He demonstrates the clear biblical understanding, both in the precursors of the Old Testament and the New, that Jesus and God the Father were not one in some incomprehensible “substance” while separate in person, but were actually distinct individuals. What made them one was their indwelling love. It is that loving unity into which they invite human beings.<br><br>In language and thought accessible to the lay reader but simultaneously rigorous and scholarly, Ostler analyzes and responds to the arguments of contemporary international theologians, reconstructs and interprets Joseph Smith’s important King Follett Discourse and Sermon in the Grove just before the Mormon prophet’s death, and argues persuasively for the Mormon doctrine of “robust deification.”<br><br>Praise for the <i>Exploring Mormon Thought</i> series:<br><br><i>“These books are the most important works on Mormon theology ever written. There is nothing currently available that is even close to the rigor and sophistication of these volumes. B. H. Roberts and John A. Widtsoe may have had interesting insights in the early part of the twentieth century, but they had neither the temperament nor the training to give a rigorous defense of their views in dialogue with a wider stream of Christian theology.

Ostler<br><br>In volume 2 of the series, <i>Exploring Mormon Thought: The Problems of Theism and the Love of God</i>, Blake Ostler explores  issues related to soteriology, or the theory of salvation. He argues that the commitment that God loves us and respects our dignity as persons entails that God must leave us free to choose whether to have a saving relationship with him. He explores the ""logic of love"" and argues that the LDS doctrine of a ""war in heaven"" embodies the commitment that God leaves us free to choose whether to enter into relationship with God. He explores the nature of inter-personal prayer and the contributions of LDS beliefs to a robust prayer dialogue. He offers a view consistent with LDS commitments that makes sense out of asking God to assist others, to alter the natural environment and to grow in relationship with God. <br><br>	He then turns to the concept of grace and argues that the traditional views lead to insurmountable problems. He argues that though God does not owe any obligation to us to give us grace, God does so out of love. However, because divinity arises from loving relationships, he argues that God could not fail to give sufficient grace to all persons and remain a loving God.<br><br>Praise for the <i>Exploring Mormon Thought</i> series:<br><br><i>“These books are the most important works on Mormon theology ever written.

"54","Exploring Mormon Thought: Volume 1, The Attributes of God","<b>Exploring Mormon Thought<br>Volume 1: The Attributes of God </b><br><br>by Blake T. Ostler<br><br>In this first volume Blake T. Ostler explores Christian and Mormon notions about God. Written for both Mormons and non-Mormons interested in the relationship between Mormonism and classical theism, his path-breaking <i>Exploring Mormon Thought: The Attributes of God</i> is a critique of classical theism regarding some of the central concepts that have formed the Christian understanding of God. He deals with questions of traditional philosophical theology including free will and foreknowledge, the nature of God and Christology. The approach to these questions is from the analytic philosophical tradition and includes detailed arguments relating to the coherence of Christian belief, scripture and practice. However he recognizes that religious faith is far more a product of intimacy with the divine than of ultimacy of reason, more a product of relationships than of logical necessities.<br><br>He provides an overview of the most influential Christian notions of deity, exploring themes and resources within this discourse that might be helpful to Latter-day Saint explorations. Also highlighted are various perspectives within Mormonism itself including a detailed analysis of Joseph Smith's Lectures on Faith and discussion of the thought of Orson and Parley Pratt, B. H. Roberts and John Widstoe. Earlier Mormon thought is demonstrated to have included a concept of God as a being in process. He suggests areas in which Mormon approaches to questions about free agency and God's omnipotence might suggest resolutions to some of the difficult issues that have troubled theologians and philosophers for centuries. For the first time ever Ostler formulates a systematic Mormon Christology.<br><br>Praise for the <i>Exploring Mormon Thought</i> series:<br><br><i>“These books are the most important works on Mormon theology ever written.

Embry<br><br>Mormons and non-Mormons all have their views about how polygamy was practiced in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Embry has examined the participants themselves in order to understand how men and women living a nineteenth-century Victorian lifestyle adapted to polygamy. Based on records and oral histories with husbands, wives, and children who lived in Mormon polygamous households, this study explores the diverse experiences of individual families and stereotypes about polygamy.The interviews are in some cases the only sources of primary information on how plural families were organized. In addition, children from monogamous families who grew up during the same period were interviewed to form a comparison group. When carefully examined, most of the stereotypes about polygamous marriages do not hold true. In this work it becomes clear that Mormon polygamous families were not much different from Mormon monogamous families and non-Mormon families of the same era.

Hales<br><br><i>Winner of the John Whitmer Historical Association’s Smith-Pettit Best Book Award!</i><br><br>Under the subject of alternative lifestyles, the issue of polygamous relationships falls squarely in the middle of the debate. Polygamous marriages are a common practice in many other countries, but the United States has vehemently opposed such unions and will no doubt find itself disputing its position on them again in the near future. As with the same-sex marriage issue, a firestorm of controversy surrounds the question since the right to participate in a polygamous union is very much tied to the right to live out one’s preferences, religious or not. Detailed accounts of sexual abuse and child brides are frequently leaked from the various polygamous societies, notwithstanding their extreme efforts to remain under the radar of law enforcement and the press. A by-product of these mysterious societies is that public interest is vitalized by their continuous efforts to gain independence from traditionalist culture. <br><br>This fascinating study seeks to trace the historical tapestry that is early Mormon polygamy, details the official discontinuation of the practice by the Church, and, for the first time, describes the many zeal-driven organizations that arose in the wake of that decision. Among the polygamous groups discussed are the LeBaronites, whose “blood atonement” killings sent fear throughout Mormon communities in the late seventies and the eighties; the FLDS Church, which made news recently over its construction of a compound and temple in Texas (Warren Jeffs, the leader of that church, is now standing trial on two felony counts after his being profiled on America’s Most Wanted resulted in his capture); and the Allred and Kingston groups, two major factions with substantial membership statistics both in and out of the United States.

The behind-the-scenes stories of those determined Saints involved in the great struggle to raise the sacred edifice bring a new appreciation to all readers.

The main body of this fascinating history covers the significant years, starting from 1840, when this temple was first considered, to the temple’s early destruction by a devastating natural disaster. A well-thought-out conclusion completes the epic by telling of the repurchase of the temple lot by the Church in 1937, the lot’s excavation in 1962, and the grand announcement in 1999 that the temple would indeed be rebuilt. Also included are an astonishing appendix containing rare and fascinating eyewitness descriptions of the temple and a bibliography of all major source materials.

It describes a Savior who walked with him through the halls of the county jail where he served as chaplain, succoring those in need.<br><br>In this slim volume, Palmer sensitively shares his understanding of what it means to know Jesus by doing his works. He lists the qualities of divine character attested to by the Apostles Peter and Paul, and also those that Jesus revealed about himself in his masterful Sermon on the Mount, particularly in the beatitudes.<br><br>With reverence Palmer shares personal spiritual experiences that were life-changing assurances of Jesus’s love for him—a love poured out unstintingly in equally life-changing blessings on prisoners whose crimes had not stopped short of sexual abuse and murder. Reading this book offers a deeper understanding of the Savior’s mercy, a stronger sense of his love, and a deeper commitment to follow him.<br><br>About the author:<br>Grant Palmer closed his thirty-four-year career teaching for the LDS Church Educational System with the final thirteen years as a chaplain and LDS Institute director at the Salt Lake County Jail.<br><br>Paperback, 157 pages, ISBN 978-1-58958-092-3","palmer_cover med.jpg","14.9500",NULL,NULL,NULL,"Theology","Palmer, Grant H."
